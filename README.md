# FreeCodeCamp-PythonForPenetrationTesting
This repository will have the python code to run a simple socket server by freeCodeCamp's "Python for Penetration Testing"
TCPSocket:
- Make sure to run with sudo when running the TCPServer.py and TCPClient.py
- Obviously both systems have to be in the same network
- It would be wonderful to inplement options and add the server's IP by commands
- This works with python3

Nmap:
- We need to have installed pip3 so we can install python-nmap
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install python-nmap
```
